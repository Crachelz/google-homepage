This was my first project EVER using HTML and CSS. I made this after 20 days of learning for the first time what HTML and CSS actually was. It took a lot of research and study for me. I didn't just copy and paste what I found out, I took the time to investigate what every command line actually did and it turned out to be a really awesome exprience. My only hope is from now on to continue studying and working on this amazing world of coding!
